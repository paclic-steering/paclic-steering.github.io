# PACLIC History

The Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC) conference has a long history, dating back to 1982. Over the years, it has developed into one of the leading conferences in the research community. The PACLIC conferences have received a wide range of interesting research papers in the fields of theoretical and computational linguistics. The specific research topics that the papers focus on can be classified into the following categories: cognitive linguistics, corpus linguistics, discourse analysis, formal grammar theory, grammar and parsing, human and machine language processing, information extraction, information retrieval, language acquisition, language resources, language technology and its application, machine translation, morphology, natural language processing, phonology, pragmatics, semantics, speech processing, syntax, and typology.

We have received paper submissions from over 21 countries or regions, including Australia, Canada, China, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Korea, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States of America. To ensure that all accepted papers meet the high-quality standards of the PACLIC conference, each submission was reviewed by three to four experts in the field.

With such a wide variety of research topics to be presented and participants from all over the world, we believe that this conference will be a truly stimulating scholarly forum. New research findings, new approaches, new ideas for tackling technical challenges, further explorations of particular research topics, and new information on current research trends will be discussed and shared both within and across disciplines. This scenario is a sign of a highly successful conference, which will benefit all the participants as well as the development of the research fields.
